things that should probably be done, but too preoccupied/lazy to do right now.

* Add signup or last login date for the user so we can track which ones need to be deleted or verified


general
----------------
apply css only to elements under #app, everything else should be static css
create event listeners for list generated elements by creating id's for them and iterating through a loop instead of checking html strings
back button for create athlete and meet
make m/f required checkboxes

security
-----------
* add two factor authentication by sending the user an email link or text.
* add a change my password option

--------
add a loading screen or refresh option on no internet access


social networking
-------------
allow the athletes to join the team via link or "class code"
allow the coach to send the athletes results of the meet via text/email 
send the athletes notifications on the meet schedual/any other notes perscribed by the coach


timer
--------------
have the user be able to swipe left or right to get to their different splits. eg on a 5k, go to 1 mile 2 mile and finish
