                Login Security
---------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind the following about out server:

* We use unique SID's to authenticate users
* It is assumed that we won't have any sql injection issues do to prepared statements
* SID's are encrypted when they are sent through ajax and will be safe

It may be of concern that session ID forgery may happen when trying to steal a user's account.
Though it is unlikely given the security precautions above, it must still be dealt with caution.
A solution would be to log the user's device and ip on the server on the user account, allowing us to identify their device.
We would then require verification on the original device for a different device to log in if only a session ID is provided.

Most common means of Account hijacking:
phishing, malware infected machines, and the reuse of passwords on third-party sites
