Error codes will be stored on the server as well as subcodes for the specific reasons.
The error functions of a specific variety will be stored in an array.
The error codes on the server will be passed through to correspond with the array indices.

This will allow us to log errors effortlessly by simply incrementing a value.

For a conclusive and accurate error reporting system we should structure an error table as thus.

CREATE TABLE error_statistics(
    date DATE,
    e_0 INT,
    e_0_1 INT,
    e_0_2 INT,
    e_1 INT,
    e_3 INT
    PRIMARY KEY(date)
);

these could be sorted by month or whatever time frame we need in order to get definate results
This may help show us what issues are users may be having or troubles we may be having with our server
